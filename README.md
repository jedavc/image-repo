# Jeremie David's image repository


This image repository allows you to create, edit, remove and modify images, pretty much like a personal cloud. 

A user can authenticate (safely, with encrypted passwords) in the app to see their images. They can log in, log out and sign up.

A user is only allowed to view, modify and delete their own images. 


### Installation

Run the following commands to get the app up and running:



```sh
$ bundle install
$ rails s
```
