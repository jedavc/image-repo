This is my first Ruby on Rails project, I wanted to make the Shopify challenge a tad more challenging.

This image repository allows you to create, edit, remove and modify images securily, pretty much like a personal cloud. 
Users can authenticate in the app to see their images. They can log in, log out and sign up.

To run the app:
run the following commands:

bundle install
rails s
